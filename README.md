## Appendix

This project was created as part of the Angular (Full App) with Angular Material, Angularfire & NgRx course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller on Udemy. The course covers a wide range of topics including Angular fundamentals, components, services, routing, forms, HTTP, and more. It also includes a section on Firebase integration and deployment.

I have updated the project to Angular 18 and made some modifications to the original code.
